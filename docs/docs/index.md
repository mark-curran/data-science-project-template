# Data Science Project Template

Welcome the documentation site for the Data Science Project Template, a codebase
that builds containers appropriate for data science projects.

While this template provides structure for a Data Science codebase, it is not meant to be prescriptive. For those looking to get [up and running quickly](quickstart/quickstart.md), the template has ready integration with docker, vscode and jupyter. For those looking to create a reusable code structure in an enterprise setting, the [design decisions](design/design.md) are also documented here. Forking this repo should be a starting point, not the final destination.

## Project Status 

This project is being actively built, and though most of the core functionality is complete the
documentation is not in a state where the template can be readily used.

## Further Information

### Quickstart and Installation

The [Quickstart section](quickstart/quickstart.md) section describes how to initialize the template and setup a local development environment.

### Template Design

Information on the template design can be found in the [Design section](design/design.md). This section describes the design decisions
behind the template, and describes the structure of the code.

### Additional Features

The [Additional Features section](additional_features/reference.md) describes how the various features of the template can be used in different scenarios.

### Further Reading

Additional information and links to the technologies used in the project can be found in the [Further Reading section](further_reading/further_reading.md).

### Distribution

See the [About section](about/about.md) for further information on distribution and reuse.
