# Data Science Project Template

Welcome to the documentation site for the Data Science Project Template, a codebase that builds containers appropriate for data science projects.

While this template provides structure for a Data Science codebase, it is not meant to be prescriptive. For those looking to get [up and running quickly](quickstart/quickstart.md), the template has ready integration with docker, vscode and jupyterlab. For those looking to create a reusable code structure in a specific enterprise setting, it might be worthwhile reading the [design decisions](design/design.md) behind the template. You may want to consider forking this repo as a starting point.

## Project Status

This core functionality of the project and documentation is complete. There are no plans for significant features to be added, but issues raised on [GitHub](https://github.com/mark-curran/data-science-project-template/issues) will be addressed.

## Further Information

### Quickstart and Installation

The [Quickstart section](quickstart/quickstart.md) section describes how to initialize the template and setup a local development environment.

### Template Design

Information on the template design can be found in the [Design section](design/design.md). This section describes the design decisions
behind the template, and the structure of the code in more detail.

### Additional Features

The Addition Features subsections describe how the various features of the template can be used in different scenarios.

### Distribution

See the [About section](about/about.md) for further information on distribution and reuse.
